1. Basic Syntax and Structure

Understanding the structure of a C program (headers, main function, etc.)
Data types (int, char, float, double)
Variables and constants
Operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise)
2. Control Flow

Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
Loops (for, while, do-while)
Break and continue statements
3. Functions

Function declaration, definition, and calling
Return types and parameters
Scope and lifetime of variables
Recursive functions
4. Pointers

Understanding pointers and their syntax
Pointer arithmetic
Pointers to functions and arrays
Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, free)
5. Arrays and Strings

One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
String handling (character arrays, string functions in &lt;string.h&gt;)
6. Structures and Unions

Defining and using structures
Nested structures
Unions and their uses
Typedef for creating new data types
7. File I/O

Reading from and writing to files
File pointers and standard I/O functions (fopen, fclose, fprintf, fscanf, etc.)
8. Preprocessor Directives

Macros and #define
Header files and #include
Conditional compilation (#ifdef, #ifndef, #endif)
9. Memory Management

Dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory
Understanding memory leaks and how to avoid them
10. Error Handling

Using errno for error detection
Handling errors in file operations and memory allocation
11. Advanced Topics

Bit manipulation
Function pointers
Multi-threading (using libraries like pthreads)
Understanding the C standard library
12. Best Practices

Code organization and modular programming
Commenting and documentation
Debugging techniques and tools (like GDB)
13. Interfacing with Hardware (for Embedded Systems)

Understanding how C interacts with hardware (if applicable)
14. C Standards and Portability

Understanding different C standards (C89, C99, C11, etc.)
Writing portable code across different compilers and platforms
